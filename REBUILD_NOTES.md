## Assets Status

### Available Assets
- ✅ Logo: `Pallyflo_Dual Grad.svg` → `public/assets/logo.svg`

### Placeholder Assets Created
The following placeholder images were created as the original assets could not be located or were not referenced in the current implementation:

- `public/assets/placeholders/hero-bg.jpg` - Hero section background
- `public/assets/placeholders/about-bg.jpg` - About page background
- `public/assets/placeholders/services-bg.jpg` - Services page background
- `public/assets/placeholders/products-bg.jpg` - Products page background

### Product Images
Product images from the documentation are available in `../output/assets/Agro Products/` but were not copied as they are not directly referenced in the current page implementations. These can be added when implementing the products page.

## Implementation Notes

### Grid System
- Responsive grid system with breakpoints: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's gap utilities
- Grid patterns match documentation: 3-column for features, 4-column for products

### Components Created
- ✅ Header with navigation and mobile menu
- ✅ Footer with contact information and links
- ✅ Button component with brand variants
- ✅ Homepage with all sections from documentation

### Pages Structure
Based on sitemap.xml, the following pages need to be created:
- ✅ Home (`/`)
- ⏳ About (`/about`)
- ⏳ Services (`/services`)
- ⏳ Products (`/products`)
- ⏳ Work With Us (`/work-with-us`)
- ⏳ Careers (`/careers`)
- ⏳ Reach Us (`/reach-us`)
- ⏳ Legal (`/legal`)
- ⏳ Privacy (`/privacy`)
- ⏳ Terms (`/terms`)

### SEO & Metadata
- ✅ Root layout with proper metadata
- ⏳ Page-specific metadata for each route
- ⏳ Open Graph tags
- ⏳ JSON-LD structured data

## Next Steps
1. Create remaining pages with proper metadata
2. Add JSON-LD structured data
3. Implement product images and galleries
4. Add contact forms and interactive elements
5. Test responsive design across devices
6. Optimize images and performance

## Assumptions Made
- Used placeholder images for backgrounds that weren't clearly identified
- Applied exact color values from documentation
- Maintained grid structure from screenshots without pixel-perfect spacing
- Used Lucide React icons for consistency
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design
